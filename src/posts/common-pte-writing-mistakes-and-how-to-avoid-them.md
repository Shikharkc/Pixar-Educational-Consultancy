The Pearson Test of English (PTE) Academic is a popular choice for Nepalese students needing to prove their English proficiency for study abroad. The Writing section, which is combined with Speaking, can be challenging. Understanding and avoiding common mistakes is key to achieving a high score.

This guide focuses on errors typically made in the two main PTE Writing tasks: **Summarize Written Text** and **Essay Writing**.

## Common Mistakes in "Summarize Written Text"

This task requires you to read a passage (up to 300 words) and summarize it in **one single sentence** between 5 and 75 words in 10 minutes.

1.  **Writing More Than One Sentence:**
    *   **Mistake:** Using full stops before the end, effectively creating multiple sentences.
    *   **Why it's bad:** The primary instruction is *one sentence*. This leads to a zero score for content.
    *   **How to Avoid:** Use conjunctions (and, but, while), relative clauses (who, which, that), semicolons (use sparingly and correctly), and participial phrases to connect ideas into a complex sentence. Plan your sentence structure.

2.  **Not Covering Main Points / Misinterpreting the Passage:**
    *   **Mistake:** Focusing on minor details or misunderstanding the central theme.
    *   **Why it's bad:** Content score will be low if the summary isn't accurate or comprehensive.
    *   **How to Avoid:** Quickly identify the topic sentence and key supporting ideas. Skim for repeated keywords or concepts. Formulate your summary around these core elements.

3.  **Exceeding or Falling Short of Word Count (5-75 words):**
    *   **Mistake:** Writing too little (missing main ideas) or too much (often leading to grammatical errors or multiple sentences).
    *   **Why it's bad:** Affects scoring for form.
    *   **How to Avoid:** Practice writing concise summaries. After drafting, count your words. If too long, identify redundant words or phrases. If too short, ensure you've included all key ideas.

4.  **Grammar, Spelling, and Punctuation Errors:**
    *   **Mistake:** Subject-verb agreement issues, incorrect tense, spelling mistakes, missing commas, or incorrect use of apostrophes.
    *   **Why it's bad:** Directly impacts grammar, vocabulary, and spelling scores.
    *   **How to Avoid:** Proofread carefully within the time limit. Pay attention to sentence structure, especially for complex sentences. Use a familiar range of vocabulary correctly.

5.  **Copying Phrases Directly Without Paraphrasing:**
    *   **Mistake:** Lifting entire sentences or long phrases from the original text.
    *   **Why it's bad:** Does not demonstrate understanding or writing skill. Can affect content score.
    *   **How to Avoid:** Use synonyms and rephrase ideas in your own words as much as possible while retaining the original meaning.

## Common Mistakes in "Essay Writing"

This task requires you to write a 200-300 word argumentative essay on a given topic in 20 minutes.

1.  **Not Addressing the Prompt Directly / Going Off-Topic:**
    *   **Mistake:** Misunderstanding the question or writing a general essay not specific to the prompt.
    *   **Why it's bad:** Leads to a low content score.
    *   **How to Avoid:** Read the prompt carefully. Identify keywords and the specific question being asked (e.g., agree/disagree, discuss both views, problem/solution). Plan your essay structure around answering this directly.

2.  **Poor Essay Structure:**
    *   **Mistake:** Lack of clear introduction, body paragraphs with distinct main ideas, or a concluding paragraph.
    *   **Why it's bad:** Affects coherence, organization, and overall clarity.
    *   **How to Avoid:** Follow a standard essay structure:
        *   **Introduction:** Paraphrase the topic, state your thesis/position.
        *   **Body Paragraphs (2-3):** Each with a clear topic sentence, supporting arguments/examples, and a concluding mini-statement.
        *   **Conclusion:** Summarize main points and restate your thesis in different words.

3.  **Insufficient Development of Ideas / Lack of Examples:**
    *   **Mistake:** Making claims without providing reasons, explanations, or relevant examples.
    *   **Why it's bad:** Weakens your arguments and makes the essay superficial.
    *   **How to Avoid:** For each main point in a body paragraph, elaborate with "why" and "how." Use specific examples (personal, general knowledge, or hypothetical) to support your claims.

4.  **Repetitive Vocabulary and Sentence Structure:**
    *   **Mistake:** Using the same words and simple sentence structures throughout the essay.
    *   **Why it's bad:** Lowers your vocabulary and grammar scores. Makes the essay monotonous.
    *   **How to Avoid:** Use a range of appropriate vocabulary (synonyms). Vary your sentence structures (simple, compound, complex).

5.  **Grammar, Spelling, and Punctuation Errors:**
    *   **Mistake:** Similar to "Summarize Written Text," but with more room for error in a longer piece.
    *   **Why it's bad:** Significantly impacts overall score.
    *   **How to Avoid:** Allocate 2-3 minutes at the end for proofreading. Focus on common error types like subject-verb agreement, articles, prepositions, and tenses.

6.  **Informal Language or Tone:**
    *   **Mistake:** Using slang, contractions (e.g., don't, can't), or overly casual phrases.
    *   **Why it's bad:** PTE essays require a formal academic tone.
    *   **How to Avoid:** Use formal vocabulary and avoid colloquialisms. Write out full forms (e.g., do not, cannot).
