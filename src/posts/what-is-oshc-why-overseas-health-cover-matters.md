If you're a Nepalese student planning to study in Australia, you will inevitably come across the term "OSHC." Understanding what OSHC is, why it's required, and what it covers is essential for your visa application and your wellbeing in Australia.

## What is Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC)?

OSHC is a mandatory health insurance for international students in Australia. It is designed to help you cover the costs of medical and hospital care you might need while studying. The Australian government requires all international students to maintain adequate health insurance for the entire duration of their stay on a student visa.

## Why is OSHC Mandatory?

Australia has an excellent public healthcare system called Medicare, but it is generally not available to international students. OSHC ensures that you have access to necessary medical services without facing significant financial hardship. Having valid OSHC is a **strict condition of your student visa (subclass 500)**. Failure to maintain continuous OSHC can lead to the cancellation of your visa.

For more on visa requirements, see our [Australia Country Guide](/country-guides#australia).

## What Does OSHC Typically Cover?

While specific coverage varies between providers, a standard OSHC policy generally covers:
*   **Doctor Visits (General Practitioner - GP):** A portion of the fee, based on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) fee. You may have a "gap" or co-payment.
*   **Public Hospital Accommodation:** As a public patient in a shared ward.
*   **Emergency Ambulance Services.**
*   **Some Prescription Medicines:** A portion of the cost for certain medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).

### What is Usually NOT Covered by Basic OSHC?
*   Dental treatment.
*   Optical services (glasses, contact lenses).
*   Physiotherapy, chiropractic, and other allied health services.
*   Treatment for pre-existing conditions (often subject to a waiting period).
*   Non-essential cosmetic surgery.

For broader coverage, you can purchase "OSHC Extras" from your provider at an additional cost.

## How to Get OSHC

You have two main options:
1.  **Through Your University:** Most universities have a "preferred provider" and can arrange OSHC for you when you accept your offer. This is often the easiest and most convenient option.
2.  **Directly from an Approved Provider:** You can choose and buy a policy directly from any of the government-approved OSHC providers. You can compare them on websites like OSHC Australia or the providers' own sites.

Approved providers include:
*   BUPA Australia
*   Medibank Private
*   Allianz Care Australia
*   nib OSHC
*   CBHS International Health

You must purchase OSHC **before** you apply for your student visa. The policy must cover you from the day you arrive in Australia until your visa expires.

## How Much Does OSHC Cost?

The cost depends on the provider, the level of cover (single, couple, or family), and the duration of your stay. As a rough estimate, a basic single policy can cost between **AUD $500 - $700 per year**. Always get a precise quote from the providers.
