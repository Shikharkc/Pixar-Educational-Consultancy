Receiving an offer letter from an international university is an exciting milestone for Nepalese students! This document, along with country-specific forms like the Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE for Australia), Form I-20 (USA), or Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS for UK), is key to your student visa application and study journey. Understanding these documents thoroughly is crucial.

## What is an Offer Letter?
An offer letter is an official document from a university or college confirming your admission to a specific program. It typically outlines:
*   Your name and student ID.
*   The full name of the course you've been accepted into.
*   The campus location.
*   The course start and end dates.
*   Tuition fees for the program (often per year or per semester).
*   Any conditions attached to the offer.

## Types of Offer Letters

1.  **Unconditional Offer Letter:**
    *   Means you have met all the academic and English language requirements for admission.
    *   You can accept this offer directly (usually by paying a deposit) to proceed.

2.  **Conditional Offer Letter:**
    *   Means your admission is subject to meeting certain conditions.
    *   **Common Conditions:**
        *   Achieving specific grades in your final exams (e.g., +2, Bachelor's).
        *   Submitting final academic transcripts and completion certificates.
        *   Achieving a required score in an English proficiency test ([IELTS, TOEFL, PTE](/book-appointment#comparison-guide)).
        *   Providing specific financial documents.
        *   Successfully completing an interview (less common at offer stage, more for visa).
    *   You cannot get your CoE/I-20/CAS or apply for a visa until these conditions are met and you receive an unconditional offer.

## Key Information to Check in Your Offer Letter

*   **Personal Details:** Ensure your name, date of birth, and other personal information are exactly as per your passport. Discrepancies can cause visa issues.
*   **Course Details:** Verify the course name, duration, and intake (e.g., Fall 2025, Semester 1 2026) are correct.
*   **Tuition Fees & Payment Deadlines:** Note the total fees, payment schedule, and deadlines for paying the deposit or first installment. Understand the refund policy.
*   **Conditions (if any):** Clearly understand what you need to do to meet the conditions and the deadline for submitting proof.
*   **Acceptance Deadline:** There's usually a deadline by which you must accept the offer and pay any required deposit.
*   **Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC - for Australia):** The offer letter might mention requirements for OSHC. (More on [OSHC here](/blog/what-is-oshc-why-overseas-health-cover-matters)).
*   **Contact Information:** Note the contact details for the university admissions office for any queries.

## Country-Specific Documents (CoE, I-20, CAS)

Once you have an unconditional offer and have paid any required deposit, the university will issue a country-specific document required for your visa application:

### 🇦🇺 Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) - Australia
*   An official document issued by Australian education providers to international students.
*   It confirms your enrolment in a specific course.
*   You need a CoE to apply for an Australian Student Visa (subclass 500).
*   It contains your personal details, course information, duration, and tuition fees paid.
*   Verify all details on your CoE carefully.
*   Learn more on our [Australia Country Guide](/country-guides#australia).

### 🇺🇸 Form I-20 ("Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status") - USA
*   Issued by SEVP-certified schools in the USA.
*   Required to apply for an F-1 Student Visa and to enter the U.S.
*   Contains your SEVIS ID, program start/end dates, estimated expenses, and funding sources.
*   You must pay the [SEVIS I-901 fee](https://www.fmjfee.com/i901fee/index.html) before your visa interview.
*   Keep your I-20 safe; you'll need it for travel and while in the U.S.
*   More info on our [USA Country Guide](/country-guides#usa).

### 🇬🇧 Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) - UK
*   A unique reference number provided by your UK sponsoring institution (university).
*   It's not a physical document but an electronic record.
*   You need this CAS number to apply for a UK Student Visa.
*   The CAS statement (a document your university might send you containing the CAS details) confirms information about you, your course, fees, and English proficiency.
*   Ensure all information used by the university to assign the CAS is accurate.
*   Our [UK Country Guide](/country-guides#uk) has more visa details.
