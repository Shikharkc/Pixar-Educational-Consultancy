Finding and applying for scholarships can be a daunting task for Nepalese students aiming to study abroad. With numerous options, varying deadlines, and different requirements, staying organized is key to maximizing your chances of securing financial aid.

To help you manage this process effectively, PixarEdu has created a **Free Scholarship Tracker Google Sheet Template**. This tool will help you keep all essential scholarship information in one place.

*(While this blog post describes the tracker, the actual Google Sheet template would need to be created by you/PixarEdu and a shareable link provided. This guide will outline what such a tracker should contain.)*

## Why Use a Scholarship Tracker?

*   **Organization:** Keep track of multiple scholarships, their deadlines, and requirements.
*   **Avoid Missing Deadlines:** A clear overview of application timelines.
*   **Track Progress:** Monitor the status of each application.
*   **Store Information:** Centralize links, contact details, and notes for each scholarship.
*   **Efficiency:** Save time by having all data readily accessible.

For a list of potential scholarships, see our blog on [Top Scholarships for International Students](/blog/top-scholarships-for-international-students-in-2025).

## What to Include in Your Scholarship Tracker (Google Sheet Columns)

Here are suggested columns for your Google Sheet template:

1.  **Scholarship Name:** (e.g., "University X International Excellence Scholarship")
2.  **University/Organization:** (Name of the institution or body offering it)
3.  **Country:** (Country where the university/organization is based - e.g., [USA](/country-guides#usa), [Australia](/country-guides#australia))
4.  **Eligibility Criteria (Brief):** (e.g., "Nepalese citizen, Bachelor's in Engineering, IELTS 7.0")
5.  **Scholarship Amount/Value:** (e.g., "AUD 10,000 per year", "Full Tuition Waiver", "25% of tuition")
6.  **Application Deadline:** (Crucial! Use a consistent date format, e.g., YYYY-MM-DD)
7.  **Link to Scholarship Page:** (Direct URL for easy access)
8.  **Required Documents:** (e.g., "SOP, LORs, Transcript, Essay on Topic X")
    *   Consider using checkboxes or a separate notes section for this.
    *   Our [Document Checklist tool](/ai-assistants#document-checklist) can help identify general application documents.
9.  **Application Status:** (e.g., "To Apply", "Researching", "Drafting Essay", "Applied", "Awaiting Result", "Successful", "Unsuccessful") - *Use a dropdown list for this.*
10. **Date Applied:** (Date you submitted the application)
11. **Result Date (Expected/Actual):**
12. **Notes:** (Any specific points, contact person, essay topics, reminders)
13. **Requires Separate Application?** (Yes/No - some scholarships are automatic upon admission, others need a distinct application)

## How to Create and Use Your Google Sheet Tracker

1.  **Create a New Google Sheet:** Go to [sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com) and start a new spreadsheet.
2.  **Set Up Columns:** Add the column headers suggested above, or customize them to your needs.
3.  **Format:**
    *   Use **Data Validation** for columns like "Application Status" to create dropdown menus.
    *   Use **Conditional Formatting** to highlight approaching deadlines (e.g., turn cells red if the deadline is within 7 days).
    *   **Freeze** the header row so it's always visible when scrolling.
4.  **Start Populating:** As you research scholarships, enter the information into your tracker immediately.
5.  **Update Regularly:** Keep the status and notes for each scholarship current.
6.  **Sort and Filter:** Use Google Sheets' sorting and filtering capabilities to view scholarships by deadline, country, or status.

**To get you started, PixarEdu could create a basic template. You can then make a copy and customize it.**
