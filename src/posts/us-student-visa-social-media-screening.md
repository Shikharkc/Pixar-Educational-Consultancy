Nepalese students planning to study in the USA should be aware of a significant part of the U.S. student visa application process: **social media screening**. This policy from the U.S. State Department requires nearly all visa applicants to disclose their social media handles on the application form. This is part of a broader effort to enhance security and vetting procedures.

## What is Social Media Screening for U.S. Visas?

On the DS-160 visa application form, you will be asked to list the social media platforms you have used in the last five years and provide your usernames or handles for each. This allows consular officers to review your public-facing online activity as part of their assessment.

The stated purpose is to identify potential security risks. Any content that indicates fraudulent intent, poses a threat, or contradicts the information in your application could negatively impact your visa decision.

## Key Implications for Nepalese F-1 Visa Applicants

*   **Disclosure is Mandatory:** You must answer the social media question truthfully. Failing to disclose an account you use or providing false information can be considered misrepresentation and lead to serious consequences, including visa denial.
*   **Focus on Public Information:** Consular officers will only look at publicly available information. They will not ask for your passwords or attempt to access private messages or friend lists.
*   **Be Mindful of Your Digital Footprint:** Everything you post publicly—including photos, comments, shares, and likes—creates a digital footprint. Be aware of how your online persona might be perceived by an official.
*   **Consistency is Key:** Your online activity should not contradict your stated purpose for traveling to the U.S. (i.e., to study and then return to Nepal). For example, posts suggesting an intent to stay permanently in the U.S. could be a red flag.
*   **Impact on Visa Interview:** Information from your social media could potentially inform the questions a consular officer asks during your [F-1 visa interview](/interview-qa#usa).

## How Should Nepalese Students Prepare?

1.  **Review Your Public Profiles:** Before applying, take a look at your public-facing content on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, TikTok, etc.
    *   Check your privacy settings to understand what is visible to the public.
    *   Consider how an outsider might interpret your posts, photos, and associations.
    *   You might choose to remove or change the privacy settings of any content that is overly political, controversial, or could be easily misconstrued.
2.  **Compile Your Handles:** Make a list of all social media accounts you have used in the last five years to ensure you can fill out the DS-160 form accurately.
3.  **Be Honest and Accurate:** List all accounts as requested. It's better to be transparent than to be caught omitting information.
4.  **Think Before You Post:** Moving forward, be conscious of what you post publicly, as it can be part of your official record for U.S. visa applications.
