Nepalese students planning to study in the USA should be aware of a significant update to the U.S. student visa application process: **mandatory social media screening**. This policy, implemented by the U.S. State Department, requires applicants to disclose their social media handles and potentially set profiles to public for review by consular officers.

This development is part of broader efforts to enhance vetting procedures for individuals seeking entry into the United States.

## What is Social Media Screening for U.S. Visas?

As part of the visa application (typically the DS-160 form for F-1 student visas), applicants are now asked to provide usernames for various social media platforms they have used in the past five years. Consular officers may review these profiles to assess an applicant's eligibility and intent.

The stated purpose is to identify potential security risks. Posts or activities perceived as hostile towards U.S. values, culture, institutions, or indicating fraudulent intent could negatively impact a visa application.

## Key Implications for Nepalese Student Visa Applicants

*   **Disclosure is Mandatory:** You must provide the requested social media information. Failure to do so or providing false information can lead to visa denial.
*   **Public Profile Expectation:** While not always explicitly stated that profiles *must* be public, consular officers need to be able to review content. Setting relevant profiles to public during the application period might be advisable, though this raises privacy concerns for many.
*   **Content Scrutiny:** Be mindful of your online presence. Content that could be misinterpreted or viewed negatively (even if not intended as such) might be scrutinized. This includes posts, shares, likes, and comments.
*   **Privacy Concerns:** This policy has raised concerns among civil liberties groups about privacy and freedom of expression. However, for visa applicants, compliance is generally necessary.
*   **Impact on Visa Interview:** Information gleaned from social media could potentially inform questions asked during your [F-1 visa interview](/interview-qa#usa).

## How Should Nepalese Students Prepare?

1.  **Review Your Online Presence:** Before applying, review your social media profiles (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, TikTok, etc.).
    *   Consider the content you have posted or shared.
    *   Think about how an outside observer might interpret your posts.
    *   You might choose to clean up or make private any content that is overly personal, controversial, or could be misconstrued.
2.  **Be Honest in Your Application:** Accurately provide all requested social media handles.
3.  **Understand "Public" vs. "Private":** If you choose to keep profiles private, consular officers may not be able to vet them, which could be a factor. If you make them public temporarily, ensure you are comfortable with what is visible.
4.  **Focus on Your Primary Goal:** Your social media should ideally not contradict your stated purpose of studying in the USA and returning to Nepal. (This relates to demonstrating non-immigrant intent, a key part of the [U.S. visa process](/country-guides#usa)).
5.  **Consult with Experts:** If you have concerns about specific content, discuss it with your educational consultant.
