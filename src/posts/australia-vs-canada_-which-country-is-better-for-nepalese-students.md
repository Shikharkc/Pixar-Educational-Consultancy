## Deep Dive into Key Considerations

### 1. Permanent Residency (PR) Opportunities
Both countries offer PR pathways for international students, but the criteria and processing times can differ.
*   **Australia:** Emphasizes skilled migration. Points are awarded for age, English proficiency, education, work experience (often in Australia), and regional study. The [Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) requirement](/blog/what-is-the-genuine-temporary-entrant-(gte)-requirement) for the student visa can sometimes be seen as contrasting with PR intentions.
*   **Canada:** Actively encourages international students to become permanent residents. The Express Entry system and Provincial Nominee Programs are popular routes. Canadian work experience gained via PGWP significantly boosts PR chances.

### 2. Cost of Education and Living
Canada generally tends to be more affordable in terms of both tuition fees and living expenses compared to Australia, especially when considering major cities. However, scholarships are available in both countries.
Use our [Student Budget Calculator blog](/blog/student-budget-calculator-–-free-tool-for-planning) to get a better idea (note: tool may be generic, tailor research).

### 3. Job Market and Opportunities
Both countries have strong economies.
*   **Australia:** Strong in mining, agriculture, tourism, healthcare, and IT.
*   **Canada:** Strong in technology, natural resources, manufacturing, finance, and healthcare.
Research specific job prospects in your field of study for each country.

### 4. Lifestyle and Climate
This is a subjective factor.
*   If you prefer warmer weather and an outdoor lifestyle, Australia might be more appealing.
*   If you enjoy distinct seasons and a diverse cultural mosaic, Canada could be a great fit.
