## Tips for Finding and Applying for Scholarships

1.  **Start Early:** Scholarship application deadlines can be much earlier than admission deadlines. Begin your research 12-18 months before your intended intake. (See our [Study Abroad Timeline](/blog/study-abroad-timeline_-from-planning-to-arrival)).
2.  **Thorough Research:** Don't just look at a few well-known scholarships. Dig deeper.
3.  **Meet Eligibility Criteria:** Carefully read and ensure you meet all requirements before applying.
4.  **Strong Academic Record:** Maintain high grades. This is crucial for merit-based scholarships.
5.  **Excel in Standardized Tests:** Good scores in [IELTS/TOEFL/PTE](/book-appointment#comparison-guide) and GRE/GMAT can strengthen your application.
6.  **Craft a Compelling Application:**
    *   **Statement of Purpose (SOP)/Essay:** Tailor it to the scholarship's objectives. Highlight your achievements, goals, and why you deserve the scholarship. (Read [How to Write an SOP That Stands Out](/blog/how-to-write-a-statement-of-purpose-that-stands-out)).
    *   **Letters of Recommendation (LORs):** Get strong recommendations from relevant referees.
    *   **CV/Resume:** Showcase your academic and extracurricular achievements. ([Sample Resume Guide](/blog/sample-resume-for-student-visa-(word-+-pdf))).
7.  **Highlight Extracurricular Activities & Leadership:** Many scholarships look for well-rounded individuals with leadership potential.
8.  **Apply for Multiple Scholarships:** Increase your chances by applying to all relevant scholarships you are eligible for.
9.  **Pay Attention to Deadlines:** Missing a deadline means a missed opportunity.
10. **Proofread Everything:** Ensure your applications are error-free.
11. **Beware of Scams:** Never pay a fee to apply for a legitimate scholarship (apart from university application fees if the scholarship is tied to admission). Be wary of "guaranteed" scholarships. ([How to Avoid Consultancy Scams](/blog/how-to-avoid-education-consultancy-scams-in-nepal)).
