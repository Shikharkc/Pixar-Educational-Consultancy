While not always mandatory for all student visa applications, a well-crafted resume or Curriculum Vitae (CV) can be a valuable supporting document for certain university admissions (especially postgraduate) and sometimes for visa purposes to showcase your overall profile. For Nepalese students, presenting your qualifications and experiences clearly is key.

This guide provides a sample structure and tips for creating an effective student resume/CV.
*(Note: This guide focuses on content and structure. For downloadable Word/PDF templates, you might search for "academic CV templates" online, then adapt using the advice below. PixarEdu can also help review your draft via our [documentation assistance service](/services#documentation-assistance).)*

## When Might You Need a Resume/CV?

*   **Postgraduate Applications:** Most Master's and PhD programs require a CV.
*   **Scholarship Applications:** Often requested to assess your achievements. (See our [scholarship tracker blog](/blog/scholarship-tracker-2025-downloadable-google-sheet) for planning).
*   **Some Undergraduate Programs:** Certain competitive undergraduate courses or universities might ask for one.
*   **Visa Applications (Selectively):** While not a primary document for all visas, it can sometimes supplement your application, especially if you have significant work experience or a study gap to explain. Always prioritize the official [document checklist for your target country's visa](/ai-assistants#document-checklist).

## Key Differences: Resume vs. CV
*   **Resume:** Typically 1-2 pages, a concise summary of skills and experiences tailored to a specific job. (Less common for initial university applications unless for co-op/internships).
*   **CV (Curriculum Vitae):** More detailed, can be longer (2+ pages for experienced individuals), comprehensive overview of academic and professional history. **This is usually what's expected for academic/postgraduate applications.**

For student purposes, the terms are often used interchangeably, but aim for the comprehensive nature of a CV.

## Sample Structure for a Student CV (Nepal Context)

### 1. Contact Information
*   **Full Name**
*   **Address (Current, Nepal)**
*   **Phone Number (with country code +977)**
*   **Email Address (Professional sounding)**
*   **LinkedIn Profile URL (Optional, but recommended if updated)**

### 2. Education
*   List in reverse chronological order (most recent first).
*   **Degree Name / Qualification:** (e.g., Bachelor of Business Administration, Higher Secondary Education Board (+2) Science)
*   **Institution Name, Location:** (e.g., Tribhuvan University, Kathmandu; St. Xavier's College, Maitighar)
*   **Graduation Date (or Expected Graduation Date):** (e.g., June 2023; Expected June 2025)
*   **GPA / Percentage / Division:** (e.g., GPA: 3.5/4.0; Percentage: 75%; First Division)
*   **Relevant Coursework/Thesis/Projects (Optional, especially for postgraduate):** Briefly mention key subjects or projects that highlight your suitability for the program you're applying to.

### 3. Work Experience / Internships (if any)
*   List in reverse chronological order.
*   **Job Title / Internship Role**
*   **Company/Organization Name, Location**
*   **Dates of Employment/Internship**
*   **Responsibilities and Achievements:** Use action verbs. Quantify achievements where possible (e.g., "Managed a team of 3...", "Increased sales by 10%...").
    *   If experience is limited, focus on transferable skills gained.

### 4. Skills
*   Categorize for clarity.
*   **Technical Skills:** (e.g., Programming Languages: Python, Java; Software: MS Office Suite, SPSS, AutoCAD, Adobe Creative Suite)
*   **Language Skills:** (e.g., Nepali (Native), English (Fluent - IELTS Score: 7.5), Hindi (Proficient))
*   **Soft Skills/Transferable Skills:** (e.g., Communication, Teamwork, Leadership, Problem-Solving, Critical Thinking, Adaptability) – *briefly mentioning where you demonstrated these can be stronger than just listing them.*

### 5. Projects (Academic or Personal)
*   If you've undertaken significant projects relevant to your field of study (especially for STEM, design, research-focused programs).
*   **Project Title**
*   **Brief Description:** Objectives, your role, technologies used, outcomes.
*   **Date/Duration**

### 6. Awards and Recognitions / Extracurricular Activities (Optional but good)
*   **Awards/Scholarships:** Academic honors, competition wins, etc.
*   **Extracurricular Activities:** Leadership roles in clubs, volunteering, sports, arts. Highlight activities that demonstrate skills like leadership, teamwork, or commitment.
*   **Publications/Presentations (for postgraduate/research):**

### 7. Statement of Purpose / Career Objective (Optional - often covered in SOP)
*   A brief 1-2 sentence summary of your career goals and how your academic pursuits align. This is often better elaborated in your main [Statement of Purpose](/blog/how-to-write-a-statement-of-purpose-that-stands-out). If included in CV, keep it very concise.

### 8. References (Optional)
*   Usually "Available upon request."
*   If a university specifically asks for references on the CV, list 2-3 academic or professional referees with their name, title, institution, email, and phone number (with their permission).

## Tips for Nepalese Students
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Use clear language. Avoid jargon unless standard in your field.
*   **Action Verbs:** Start bullet points with strong action verbs (e.g., Managed, Developed, Analyzed, Led, Collaborated).
*   **Quantify Achievements:** Use numbers to demonstrate impact where possible.
*   **Tailor It:** Adjust your CV slightly for different programs or universities, highlighting the most relevant experiences and skills.
*   **Formatting:** Keep it professional, clean, and easy to read. Use consistent formatting (font, size, spacing). PDF format is usually best for submission.
*   **Proofread Meticulously:** Typos and grammatical errors create a poor impression. Ask someone to review it.
*   **Honesty:** All information must be truthful and verifiable.
