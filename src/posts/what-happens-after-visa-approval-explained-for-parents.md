Congratulations! Your child receiving their student visa is a moment of immense joy and relief for Nepalese families. It marks a significant step towards their dream of studying abroad. But what comes next? This guide outlines the crucial steps parents can help with after visa approval to ensure a smooth transition for your child.

This guide complements our [Pre-Departure Checklist for First-Time Travelers](/blog/pre-departure-checklist-for-first-time-travelers) and our comprehensive [Pre-Departure Toolkit](/pre-departure-toolkit).

## Immediate Steps After Visa Approval

1.  **Verify Visa Details:**
    *   Carefully check all details on the visa sticker or e-visa document: name, passport number, date of birth, visa validity dates, entry conditions (e.g., "must not arrive before X date"), and any work rights.
    *   Report any discrepancies to the visa office or your consultant immediately.

2.  **Book Flights:**
    *   Once the visa is confirmed and dates are clear, book your child's flight tickets.
    *   Consider direct flights if possible, or routes with manageable transit times.
    *   Book well in advance for better fares, especially during peak student travel seasons.
    *   Confirm baggage allowance with the airline.

3.  **Confirm Accommodation:**
    *   If university accommodation was conditional upon visa, finalize the booking now.
    *   If seeking private accommodation, intensify your search and secure a place. (See [How to Find Student Accommodation Abroad Safely](/blog/how-to-find-student-accommodation-abroad-safely)).
    *   Ensure your child has the full address and contact details for their accommodation upon arrival.

4.  **Finalize Health Insurance:**
    *   Ensure mandatory health insurance (e.g., [OSHC for Australia](/blog/what-is-oshc-why-overseas-health-cover-matters), provincial plans for Canada, or university-required plans for USA/UK) is active from the date of arrival.
    *   Keep a copy of the insurance policy easily accessible.

5.  **Inform the University:**
    *   Notify the university of your child's visa approval and expected arrival date, especially if they offer airport pickup or orientation programs.

## Financial Preparations

*   **Tuition Fee Payments:** If any remaining tuition fees are due before travel or upon arrival, make arrangements for payment.
*   **Living Expenses:**
    *   Transfer initial living expenses to your child's account or arrange for a forex card / traveler's cheques.
    *   Discuss how ongoing financial support will be managed.
*   **Open a Bank Account (If Possible in Advance):** Some banks allow international students to start the process of opening an account in the destination country even before arrival. Research this option.
*   **Currency Exchange:** Exchange a sufficient amount of Nepali Rupees into the local currency for immediate needs upon arrival.

## Packing and Essentials

*   **Refer to Checklists:** Use our [Pre-Departure Checklist](/blog/pre-departure-checklist-for-first-time-travelers) and [Toolkit](/pre-departure-toolkit).
*   **Pack for the Climate:** Research the weather in the destination city.
*   **Essential Documents:** Ensure all original documents (passport, visa, offer letter, CoE/I-20/CAS, academic papers, financial proofs) are in their hand luggage. Make copies.
*   **Medications:** Pack any prescribed medications with a doctor's note.
*   **Electronics & Adapters:** Laptop, phone, chargers, and a universal travel adapter.

## Health and Safety
*   **Final Medical/Dental Check-ups:** Before departure.
*   **Emergency Contacts:** Compile a list of emergency contacts in Nepal and in the destination country (university, embassy, local friends/relatives if any).
*   **Discuss Safety:** Talk about general safety precautions, local laws, and cultural norms.

## Emotional Preparation and Support (Parent's Role)
This is a significant transition for your child (and for you!).
*   **Encourage Independence:** While providing support, also empower your child to handle new responsibilities.
*   **Stay Positive and Reassuring:** Acknowledge their excitement and any anxieties.
*   **Discuss Communication:** Plan how you will stay in touch (WhatsApp, video calls).
*   **Cultural Adjustment:** Talk about potential culture shock and how to cope.
*   **Celebrate Their Achievement!** This is a big milestone.
