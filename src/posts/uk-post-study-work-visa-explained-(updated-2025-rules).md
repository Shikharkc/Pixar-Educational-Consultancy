The UK's Graduate Route visa, often referred to as the Post-Study Work (PSW) visa, is a significant attraction for Nepalese students choosing the [United Kingdom for their higher education](/country-guides#uk). It allows eligible international students to stay in the UK to work, or look for work, for a period after successfully completing their studies. This guide explains the key aspects of the Graduate Route based on current understanding for 2025.

**Important Note:** UK immigration rules are subject to change. Always refer to the [official GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/graduate-visa) for the most up-to-date information and eligibility criteria.

## What is the UK Graduate Route Visa?

The Graduate Route is an unsponsored work route, meaning you do not need a job offer to apply. It provides an opportunity for international graduates from UK universities to gain work experience, develop their careers, or pursue entrepreneurship in the UK for a limited period.

## Key Features of the Graduate Route

*   **Duration of Stay:**
    *   **2 years** for students who have successfully completed an undergraduate or Master's degree.
    *   **3 years** for students who have successfully completed a PhD or other doctoral qualification.
*   **No Job Offer Required:** You can apply without having a specific job lined up.
*   **No Minimum Salary Requirement:** Unlike some other work visas, there's no minimum salary threshold to meet.
*   **Flexibility in Work:** You can work in most jobs (some restrictions apply, e.g., not as a professional sportsperson). You can also be self-employed.
*   **Switching to Other Visas:** Towards the end of your Graduate Route visa, you may be able to switch to other visa categories, such as the [Skilled Worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa), if you meet the requirements.

## Eligibility Criteria for the Graduate Route

To be eligible, you generally must:

1.  **Be in the UK:** You must apply from inside the UK.
2.  **Current Student Visa:** Hold a valid Student visa (or Tier 4 general student visa) at the time of application.
3.  **Successful Course Completion:** Have successfully completed an eligible UK degree (Bachelor's, Master's, or Doctorate) or other eligible qualification at a UK higher education provider with a "track record of compliance." Your education provider will notify the Home Office of your successful completion.
4.  **Study Location:** You must have studied your eligible course in the UK for a minimum required period (usually at least 12 months if your course is longer than 12 months, or the full course duration if shorter). Specific COVID-19 concessions regarding online study may have applied previously but are less likely to be relevant for 2025 completions unless specific new policies arise. **Always check current guidance.**
5.  **Application Timing:** Apply *before* your current Student visa expires and after your education provider has notified the Home Office of your successful course completion.

## How to Apply
The application is typically done online via the GOV.UK website. You will need to:
*   Provide your identity documents (e.g., passport, Biometric Residence Permit - BRP).
*   Pay the visa application fee.
*   Pay the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) for the duration of the visa.
*   Provide your Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) number that was used for your successful Student visa application. (More on [CAS here](/blog/how-to-read-and-understand-a-coe-or-offer-letter)).

## Important Considerations for Nepalese Students
*   **Financial Requirements:** While there's no specific maintenance fund requirement for the Graduate Route application itself (unlike the Student visa), you must be able to support yourself financially while in the UK.
*   **Does Not Lead Directly to Settlement (ILR):** Time spent on the Graduate Route does not typically count directly towards Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR). You would usually need to switch to another visa category (like Skilled Worker) that does lead to settlement.
*   **Dependants:** If your dependants (partner, children) are already in the UK with you on your Student visa, they can usually apply to stay as your dependants on the Graduate Route.
*   **One-Time Opportunity:** You can usually only benefit from the Graduate Route once.

## Planning Your Career Post-Graduate Route
While the Graduate Route offers flexibility, it's wise to plan:
*   **Gain Relevant Experience:** Use the time to find work experience related to your field of study.
*   **Network:** Build professional connections in the UK.
*   **Explore Long-Term Options:** If you wish to stay longer, research pathways like the Skilled Worker visa well before your Graduate Route visa expires.
