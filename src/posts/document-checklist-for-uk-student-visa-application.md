Applying for a UK Student Visa can seem daunting, but having a clear checklist of required documents is crucial for a successful application from Nepal. This guide outlines the essential documents you'll typically need.

**Important Note:** UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) requirements can change. Always refer to the [official GOV.UK website](https://www.gov.uk/student-visa) for the most up-to-date information and specific requirements for your situation.

## Core Documents for UK Student Visa Application

1.  **Valid Passport:**
    *   Must be valid for at least six months beyond your intended stay in the UK.
    *   Should have at least one blank page for the visa.
    *   Copies of any previous passports/visas might be useful.

2.  **Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) Number:**
    *   This is a unique reference number you receive from your UK university (your visa sponsor) once you've accepted an unconditional offer.
    *   The CAS contains information about you, your course, your university, and the fees paid.
    *   You'll need to enter this number on your visa application form. Learn [how to understand your offer letter/CAS](/blog/how-to-read-and-understand-a-coe-or-offer-letter).

3.  **Proof of Financial Capacity (Maintenance Funds):**
    *   You must show you have enough money to pay for your course fees (for the first year, if your course is longer) AND living costs.
    *   **Living Costs:**
        *   £1,334 per month (for up to 9 months) for courses in London.
        *   £1,023 per month (for up to 9 months) for courses outside London.
    *   **Funds must be held in your (or your parent's/legal guardian's) bank account for a consecutive 28-day period** ending no more than 31 days before your visa application date.
    *   Acceptable financial documents include bank statements, building society passbooks, or a letter from a regulated financial institution confirming funds.
    *   If relying on parents' funds, you'll need their consent letter and proof of relationship (e.g., birth certificate).
    *   For detailed guidance, refer to our [Visa Support services](/services#visa-support).

4.  **Academic Documents:**
    *   Certificates and transcripts listed on your CAS statement (e.g., SLC/SEE, +2, Bachelor's degrees).
    *   Originals are typically required, and you may need certified translations if not in English.

5.  **English Language Proficiency Proof:**
    *   Usually an IELTS UKVI, PTE Academic UKVI, or other SELT (Secure English Language Test) certificate meeting your university's and UKVI's requirements.
    *   The specific test and score will be mentioned on your CAS.
