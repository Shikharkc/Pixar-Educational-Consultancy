A recent report published by the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration and Shorelight reveals the **critical role international students play in supporting the U.S. economy and higher education ecosystem**.

## 📈 Economic Impact

According to the report, international students contributed over **$40 billion to the U.S. economy** in 2023, supporting more than **368,000 jobs**. Their presence extends far beyond tuition—they rent housing, spend on food, travel, and engage with local communities.

> “Every international student is an investment in American innovation and prosperity,” the report emphasizes.

## 🎓 Academic and Workforce Benefits

- **STEM and Research Boost**: Many international students are enrolled in **STEM and doctoral-level programs**, filling vital gaps in research and development.
- **Talent Retention**: International graduates are more likely to remain and work in the U.S. under Optional Practical Training (OPT) or H-1B visas, contributing directly to tech, healthcare, and engineering sectors.

## 🛂 A Call for Smarter Policies

Despite the massive value brought by international students, the U.S. is losing market share to countries like **Canada, the UK, and Australia**, who are implementing **more welcoming immigration pathways**. The report urges the U.S. to:

- Streamline visa processes  
- Expand dual-intent policies  
- Improve clarity around work opportunities post-graduation

## 🌍 Why This Matters for Students

As global competition increases, the U.S. needs to reposition itself as a top-tier destination for talented, diverse, and ambitious international learners. For students considering the U.S., this could mean:

- **More favorable immigration reforms** in the near future  
- **Greater access to employment and career opportunities** post-graduation  
- **Stronger institutional support** from U.S. universities actively advocating for international students
