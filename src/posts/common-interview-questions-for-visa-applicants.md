The student visa interview is a critical step in your journey to study abroad. Visa officers aim to assess your genuineness as a student, your financial capacity, and your intent to return to your home country after studies. Being well-prepared for common questions can significantly boost your confidence and chances of success.

This guide covers typical questions for popular destinations like the USA, Australia, UK, and Canada. For detailed country-specific Q&A, visit our [Student Visa Interview Q&A page](/interview-qa).

2.  **Academic Background:** Your previous education and performance.
3.  **Financial Capacity:** How will you fund your studies and living expenses?
4.  **Post-Graduation Plans & Ties to Home Country:** Your intentions after completing your course.
5.  **General Knowledge & Awareness:** About your chosen country and institution.
