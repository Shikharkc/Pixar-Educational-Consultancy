One of the key requirements for Nepalese students aspiring to study abroad in English-speaking countries is demonstrating English language proficiency. Universities and visa authorities set minimum score requirements for tests like IELTS, TOEFL iBT, and PTE Academic. Understanding these typical minimums can help you set realistic preparation goals.

**Crucial Disclaimer:** Minimum scores vary WIDELY based on the **country, university, and specific program (e.g., Bachelor's, Master's, PhD; competitive fields like Medicine or Law often require higher scores)**. **Always check the exact requirements on the official website of each university you are applying to.** This guide provides general ranges only.

## Factors Affecting Required Scores
*   **University Ranking/Prestige:** Top-tier universities generally have higher English proficiency requirements.

*   **Apply to Institutions with Lower Requirements:** Consider other universities or colleges whose requirements you meet.
*   **Improve English Skills:** Dedicate more time to overall English language improvement before retaking.
