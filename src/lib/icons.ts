// This file can be used to re-export commonly used icons if needed,
// or to define custom SVG icon components.
// For now, it's kept minimal as icons are directly imported from lucide-react.

// Example of re-exporting (if you prefer this pattern):
// export { Home, Info, Settings } from 'lucide-react';

// Example of a custom SVG icon component:
/*
import type { SVGProps } from 'react';

export const MyCustomIcon = (props: SVGProps<SVGSVGElement>) => (
  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" {...props}>
    <path d="M12 2L2 7l10 5 10-5-10-5zM2 17l10 5 10-5M2 12l10 5 10-5" />
  </svg>
);

// The Testimonial interface was moved to data.tsx to consolidate types with their data.
// If you had other type definitions here that are specific to icons or icon-related logic,
// they could remain. But general data types are better co-located with the data itself.
